# Repository Operation Barcode, with Robot C and MATLAB!

What your code can do?
- My Code can command a robot to sense the light colour sensors of various barcodes with varying width's and intensities
- Also able to turn those data points in a chart that can be graphed visualized
- The Code is able to determine when and where the portions of the barcode are black or white and return a corresspoding value, and it's letter

What your code cannot do?
- My code is not able detect values other than letter's between letters A-Z and Numbers 0-9, other values must be given first in order to do so.
- The robot can also not detect colours other than black or white
- This program cannot handle more than 2 bits of information, ie only 3 or 1, not 1,2...10 bits.
